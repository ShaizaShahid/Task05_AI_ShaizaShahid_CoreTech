# Task05_AI_ShaizaShahid_CoreTech

Project Title
Loan Approval Classification Model

📖 Project Description

This project is part of Task 05 – Artificial Intelligence (AI) for CoreTech.
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. The model uses Python and a Decision Tree algorithm.

🎯 Objective

To develop a simple AI classification model that:

Processes real-world loan data

Predicts loan approval status

Measures model accuracy

Visualizes prediction results

🧰 Tools and Technologies Used

Google Colab

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib
